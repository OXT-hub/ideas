- THE FATHER WILL ALWAYS PROTECT THE DAUGHTER, BUT THE MOTHER WILL NOURISH THE SON ( this could be a comment on the shift of power across gender lines, predicated on the projected tension between the sexes — a lot of online dialogue seems to be about that these days, at least my algorithm, women in the historical pressure cooker ready to emerge again as the true sovereign of earth — too much? 😅Something about containing multitudes, Walt Whitman, your grandma carrying everybody in her eggs 🍳 mom and dad both)
